# HarrysPitBossUtils
1.8.9 Utils mod primarily focused around Harrys Pit boss fights, using Lukfig Panel Studio base

This was a project done in my freetime between work and school, please let me know if you encounter any errors!

Right Ctrl is default key to open the clickgui, and can be changed. Persistence has been added to save the new key

## Features:
* Saved settings between launches (toggled modules, height settings for the HUD)

## Modules:
* Autoclicker - 1-14 cps setting, toggle for if holding left click is required
* CurseDropEstimate - Bar that ticks every boss kill, until your fourth when you are guaranteed a curse orb drop
* SpawnTimers - Caches all spawners and their quadrent with labels. Upon activating a spawner, it sets that spawner on a 12 minute cooldown.
* ShadowWarning - Warns boss about to proc shadow
* ShatterWarning - Warns boss about to proc shatter
* RoombaWarning - Warns boss about to proc Roomba
* SessionStats - Currently only tracks gold gain. Activates upon any digit in your streak counter, and ends when you return to spawn

## TODO:
* Clean up redundant logic
* Rework warning handling for bosses that have 2 of roomba/shatter/shadow, and ready procs
* Highlight the beams between pylons and the boss/other pylons
* Nuke Highlight
* Boss health display
* Real weeny tracker
* Eviscerate Warning
* Quick menu buttons (button to open /craftcurse, any others people may want)
* update needed for new map quadrents
