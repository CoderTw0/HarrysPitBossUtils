# HarrysPitBossUtils
1.8.9 Utils mod primarily focused around Harrys Pit boss fights, using Lukfig Panel Studio base

This was a project done in my freetime between work and school, please let me know if you encounter any errors!

Features:
Saved settings between launches (toggled modules, height settings for the HUD)

Modules:
Autoclicker - 1-14 cps setting, toggle for if holding left click is required
CurseDropEstimate - Bar that ticks every boss kill, until your fourth when you are guaranteed a curse orb drop
SpawnTimers - Display all timers of boss spawners in range, including time till ready, and time till expiring
ShadowWarning - Warns boss about to proc shadow
ShatterWarning - Warns boss about to proc shatter
RoombaWarning - Warns boss about to proc Roomba

TODO:
Clean up redundant logic
Rework warning handling for bosses that have 2 of roomba/shatter/shadow
Highlight the beams between pylons and the boss/other pylons
Map detection logic for the boss timers
